# Simmer

A Rust library crate that expresses some standard units of temperature. It's compatible with embedded systems, happily converts between units, and unwraps internal values when you're ready to leave.

## Usage

There's not much detail to this crate. You can get started with the code below!

```rust
use simmer::Temperature;

fn main() {
    let ice = Temperature::Fahrenheit(32.0);
    println!("water freezes at {ice} degrees fahrenheit");

    let ice_c = ice.to_celsius();
    println!("water freezes at {ice_c} degrees celsius");

    let ice_raw_c: f64 = ice_c.into();
    println!("here's a number: {ice_raw_c}");
}
```
