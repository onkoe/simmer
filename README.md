# Simmer

A Rust library crate that expresses some standard units of temperature. It's compatible with embedded systems, happily converts between units, and unwraps internal values when you're ready to leave.

## Features

- `Temperature`, a simple wrapper for a float that stores some temperature
- A `CheckedTemperature` type, which only allows 'correct' temperatures
- `Display`, `Debug`, and the `ufmt` counterparts
- `f32` and `f64` support
- Embedded-aware and tested

## Usage

There's not much detail to this crate. You can get started with the code below!

```rust
use simmer::Temperature;

fn main() {
    let ice = Temperature::Fahrenheit(32.0);
    println!("water freezes at {ice} degrees fahrenheit");

    let ice_c = ice.to_celsius();
    println!("water freezes at {ice_c} degrees celsius");

    let ice_raw_c: f64 = ice_c.into();
    println!("here's a number: {ice_raw_c}");
}
```

### Checked

There's also a CheckedTemperature type to store and use temperatures safely. Here's a quick example of that:

```rust
fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    let ice = CheckedTemperature::new(Temperature::Fahrenheit(32.0))?;
    println!("water freezes at {ice} degrees fahrenheit");

    let ice_c = ice.to_celsius()?;
    let ice_raw_c: f64 = ice_c.into(); // can also use `f32` ðŸ˜„
    println!("here's a number: {ice_raw_c}");
    
    Ok(())
}
```
